# Argo-Diff

Application written in [go](https://go.dev/) that provides Github status checks and Pull Request comments
for changes to Kubernetes manifests when those manifests are delivered via
[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Overview

Argo-diff is designed to receive webhook notifications from Gihtub for `push` and `pull_request` events. When
events are received, it queries the ArgoCD API to pull manifests for the Argo application(s) configured for
the repository that is the source of the push or pull request. It will fetch live manifests deployed to your
k8s cluster, predicted manifests generated at the revision of the change, and generate a diff.

If ArgoCD cannot generate manifests for the revision of the change, argo-diff will set its status check to a
failure for that associated commit.

If the event is for a pull request, argo-diff will comment on the associated pull request with markdown
displaying the diff of the manifests.

Argo-diff will not run (but may still produce status checks) in the following situations:
- Base branch of the pull request (branch in which the PR will be merged) is not the target revision for the
    Argo application. (eg: Your Argo application targets `production`, but your PR is to be merged into
    `dev`.)
- Any git push that is not a branch. (eg: When tags are pushed, they are completely ignored by argo-diff.)
- When your application has an
    [Automated Sync Policy](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/) configured, and
    commits are pushed to that application's target branch. (ie: There's no need to run argo-diff, when ArgoCD
    will automatically pick up the change.)

### Why argo-diff?

There are multiple ways to produce diff previews of proposed manifest changes to ArgoCD applications in Github
Pull Requests, but they often require per-repository configuration. Because argo-diff is triggered by Github
event notifications, and because argo-diff auto-discovers ArgoCD applications configured in the source code
repository, no configuration is needed when repositories and/or ArgoCD applications are added and removed.

## Deploying

- Generate a fine-grained Github Personal Access Token. It should have the following Repository permissions:
  - **Administration**: `Read-only`
  - **Commit statuses**: `Read and write`
  - **Metadata**: `Read-only`
  - **Pull requests**: `Read and write`
- Create a user in your ArgoCD instance. This user should have read-only access to all applications:
  - For example, in _policy.csv_: `g, argo-diff, role:ci` and `p, role:ci, applications, get, *, allow`
  - This user shouldn't need a password but does need an API token to be generated.
- Generate a webhook secret that will be shared both by the argo-diff deployment and Github webhook config.
- Deploy to Kubernetes:
  - The recommended approach is to use the Helm chart included in [charts/argo-diff/](charts/argo-diff/):
    ```console
    $ helm install my-release oci://ghcr.io/vince-riv/chart/argo-diff
    ```
  - You can also use the example manifests in the `docs/k8s/` directory to deploy argo-diff to the argocd
    namespace of your Kubernetes cluster. An Ingress or IngressRoute will need to be added to allow
    webhooks in from Github to the `/webhook` endpoint on the argo-diff Service.
- Configure organizational (or perhaps just repository level?) webhook notifications to argo-diff. The Payload
    URL should map the ingress configured in your cluster, and the secret should be the webhook secret
    previously generated. Invididual event types to configure:
  - **Issue comments** (for future use)
  - **Pull requests**
  - **Pushes**
- After the webhook is activated, the ping event should be received and verified by argo-diff and this will
    validate connectivity from Github to argo-diff

## Limitations

This is still in a proof-of-concept and alpha/beta version state, so there are some known limitations.

- If there's a problem, and the diff comment needs to be regenerated, an admin must redeliver the webhook
    event associated with the PR. In the future, argo-diff may be re-initated by a comment on the PR. [#11]
- Changes to Secrets are _not_ displayed. A future enhancement could flag that secrets are changing without
    displaying the contents. [#52]
- Only supports Github Personal Access Tokens at this time. [#14]
- When many Argo applications are served by a single repository, performance may be slow. Manifests for eac
    Argo application are fetched sequentially, so this could result in argo-diff statuses and/or comments
    taking minutes to complete.

## Running locally

Set environment variables used by argo-diff and then execute `go run cmd/main.go`.

For example, you can place these in a file called `.env.sh`:

```sh
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN='github_pat_XXXX'
ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN='ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
ARGOCD_SERVER_ADDR='argocd.your.domain:443'
ARGOCD_UI_BASE_URL='https://argocd.your.domain'
APP_ENV='dev'
```

Then source it and execute go run:

```
$ set -o allexport ; . .env.sh ; set +o allexport
$ go run cmd/main.go
```

To send requests, you can copy webhook request headers and payloads to `temp/curl-headers.txt` and
`temp/curl-payload.json` and use the `post-local.sh` script to ship them to the local server.

There is also the `/dev` endpoint that gets enabled when `APP_ENV=dev` - this endpoint is handled by
`devHandler()` in main.go and can be hardcoded to specific event data.

## Development Notes

This was originally developed by @vrivellino as a way to learn Go. Its functionality replicates that of an
internal tool written by smart people at a previous job.
