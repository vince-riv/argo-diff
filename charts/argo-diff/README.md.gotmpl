## Extended Description

The Argo Diff chart provides a method of comparing the generated manifests in a PR to the manifests that are currently deployed in the cluster. Then argo diff comments on the PR with any changes to ensure that the PR is not introducing any unexpected changes.

## Installing the Chart


## Aids to navigation

- `templates/` contains all of the templates that are rendered by this chart.
  Note that files starting with `_` are not used to generate output directly,
  but the constructs therein are accessible by other template files (handy for
  reusable template fragments).
- `values.yaml` contains the default configuration parameters for the chart.
  This is also where we document configuration options for end users. Be sure to
  read https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/ before editing this
  file.
